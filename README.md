# LINKED LIST

## STARTING THOUGHTS

For this assignment we have to build two seperate classes.  A LinkedList class which will represented the full list,
and probably be the parent for the Node class, which will be the second class to build.  The Node class will contain the
data associated with the object, as well as a pointer directing to the next object on the linked list.  Within the parent
class I will build different methods to help iterate and manipulate the nodes on the data structure. The list will have to be initialized with a head node that will point to null until data is added.

### LinkedList Class

Parent of the Node class. 


### Node Class

Child of the LinkedList class.  This will need to contain a #value method as well as a link to the next node.
